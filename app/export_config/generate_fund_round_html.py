    Generates an HTML representation for a specific funding round.

    This function creates an HTML document that represents all the sections and forms
    associated with a given funding round. It retrieves the round and its related fund
    information, iterates through each section of the round to collect form data, and
    then generates HTML content based on this data.

    Args:
        round_id (str): The unique identifier for the funding round.

    The process involves:
    1. Fetching the round details using its ID.
    2. Collecting data for each section and its forms within the round.
    3. Generating print data for the sections.
    4. Converting the print data into HTML content.
    5. Writing the HTML content to a file named 'html_full' within a directory
       corresponding to the round's short name.

    The generated HTML is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the round,
    including details of each section and form, for printing or web display purposes.
